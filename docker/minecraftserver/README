Ubuntu 20.04 host configuration is as follows. Adjust paths to match if your 
distro is different.

Default docker volume = minecraft
Default ENVFOLDER = /var/snap/docker/common/var-lib-docker/volumes/minecraft/_data/ENVFOLDER
Default systemd service = /etc/systemd/system/

Ramdisk is an option for your worlds. You will need to create the ramdisk and
have it mount inside of your docker volume. There is a RAMDISK variable in the
ENVFOLDER/example file.

Default ramdisk mount = /var/snap/docker/common/var-lib-docker/volumes/minecraft/_data/RAMDISK

TO DO - Working on a world generation script so one doesn't have to manually
create the file in the ENVFOLDER.
