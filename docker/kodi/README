Initial configuration is done on first run.

docker run -id --restart always --name kodiheadless -h kodiheadless --mount source=kodiheadless,destination=/root -p 58080:8080 -p 58081:5900 kodiheadless

Ports are Kore and VNC server respectively. Adjust as needed.

Mounted directory configuration files.

Edit the pulseserver file to enter your specific remote pulse server location.
Edit startup.sh as needed. I leave it the way it is for my current setup.

Enjoy. Working great as a remote audio player. Fully functional with Kore remote using the library views.
Currently have it going to my living room Xubuntu / Kodi network boot. A raspberry pi directly connected to
a sound system would be perfect.
